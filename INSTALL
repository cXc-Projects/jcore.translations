Welcome to jCore,

Thank you for your interest, please see below step by step 
instructions to install jCore server on your server.

The following instructions are mostly for users who have a 
server set up with directories for each user/client and have
full access to that server but with some modifications you should
be able to install jcore even without full access.

As I use cpanel for my hosting (btw I use Hostgator) the settings
best apply to those situations.

There are two ways to install jCore server, one is to install it
as a standalone system meaning you will run a website on it and not
use it as a core for the jCore clients, and the other way is to 
install it as a core system where you still will be able to run 
a website on the top of it but usually not recommended.


INSTALL jCore Server
--------------------
1: Download the installer (install.php) from 
   http://jcore.net/downloads/installer
   
2: Put install.php in a public html folder and load it using
   your browser and that's it.


MANUAL INSTALL jCore Server as Core System
------------------------------------------
1: Copy the content of this directory to a global place. Usually
   I use /var/www/jcore/ directory.
   
2: Create a subdomain for your main domain where you would like 
   to access the jCore server, for e.g. it could be
   jcore.yourdomain.com which will create a directory in your home
   /home/yourdomain.com/public_html/jcore/
   
3: Now delete the jcore directory just got created in your home folder
   (/home/yourdomain.com/public_html/jcore/) and create a symlink
   to /var/www/jcore/
   
4: That's it, just make sure to configure the jCore clients with the
   right url/path defined above and everything should work just fine.
   
   
MANUAL INSTALL jCore Server as Stand Alone website
--------------------------------------------------
1: Copy the content of this directory to a home folder, for e.g.
   /home/yourdomain/public_html/

2: Once content is copied and IF NO PHPChmod is activated
   give write access to the following directories to everyone:
   
   rss/
   sitefiles/banner/
   sitefiles/design/
   sitefiles/file/
   sitefiles/flash/
   sitefiles/image/
   sitefiles/media/


SETTING UP MySQL
----------------
1: Now we have everything set up we just need to configure it 
   but before that we need to setup the MySQL db for the site.
   To do that please go to your cpanel, usually
   http://yourclient.com:2082 and click "MySQL Databases".
   
   Here you should create a db, enter the name for your db
   New Database: [yourdb]
   
   Please note: your db will be prenamed with your clients'
   username, for e.g. it will look like this:
   yourclient_yourdb
   
   I usually enter only DB when creating a new database for
   my clients and then I have a db called myclient_DB
   
2: After you have set up the db you have two options, or you
   create a user for this new db or you just use the one
   you used to login to cpanel as that one will work too.
   
   For safety I recommend to use a new user/password for 
   the db connection, just scroll down and where it says 
   "Add New User" enter the username and the passwords, click
   Create user and that's it.
   
   Now below "Add User to Database", select the new user you
   created and for the Database select the DB you created and 
   click Add and check all privileges for the user and that should be.
   
3: After we have the DB set up, it's time to import the SQL file.
   First in your cpanel go back to home and click the "phpMyAdmin"
   icon and select your new db just created.
   
   NOTE: You should define a Collation for your db click on the 
   "Operations" in phpMyAdmin as this charset will be used for your
   whole db and if you want characters like Hungarian you should set this
   to latin2_hungarian_ci for example.
   
4: Click "Import" in phpMyAdmin and browse to the jCore-client-0.1.sql
   file you downloaded and click "Go"
   This will import the tables and set up some example entries for you.
   

CONFIGURING jCORE Server
------------------------
1: Now we should have both jCore and MySQL set up, it's time to configure
   it to use the right core and database.
   
   Go to your jCore servers directory and edit config.inc.php as following:
   
   SQL_HOST (you should leave it as it is, change it only if needed)
   SQL_DATABASE (the new database you created, for e.g. yourclient_DB)
   SQL_USER (the new user you created for your database)
   SQL_PASS (the password for the user)
   
   SITE_URL_PATH (the url of your new site, for.e.g http://yourdomain.com/)
      NOTE: please always add a slash to the end of the url!

   SITE_ABSOLUTE_PATH (this should be the home directory of your user, for
      e.g. /home/yourdomain/public_html/)
      NOTE: please always add a slash to the end of the path!
      
   SEO_FRIENDLY_LINKS (this will allow you to see the urls like 
      http://yourdomain.com/about instead of http://yourdomain.com?menuid=1)

2: That should be all, now test out your site, just enter the servers url
   into your browser (http://yourdomain.com) and you should see the site.
   

IMPORTANT: if you see a message saying that "Site Temporary Unavailable"
it means that something is wrong and php can't access the db with the 
user/password you have provided above, in that case please make sure
that all (sql_user, sql_pass, sql_database) are spelled right and try again.
